- Emulates real world envelope
- [[Commitment scheme.canvas|Commitment scheme]]
- Properties:
	- Hiding\: 
		- Commitment "c" reveals nothing about message "m", and 'r' is  uniformly sampled
	- Binding :
	    - Message cannot be changed after commitment
	    - A commitment cannot be opened at two points ie (m1,r), ( m2,r)  such that verify(m1,r,c) == verify(m2,r,c) = accept
	    - Only valid when, m1 != m2 for different commitments

- Hash based commitments: 
	- Commit(m,r) = H(m,r) => c
	- Verify(m,r,c) = (H(m,r) == c) => accept or reject
- [[Functional commitment.canvas|Functional commitment]] : 
	- Linear commitment
	- Multilinear commitment
	- Polynomial commitment
